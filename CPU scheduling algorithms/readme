Description:
	The main idea of the project is to implement the following CPU scheduling algorithms.
                1. First Come First Serve.
                2. Shortest Job First.
                3. Highest Response Ratio Next.
                4. Round Robin.
                5. Multilevel Scheduling with Shortest Job First.
            The program reads a list of tasks from a file and then schedules them based on the chosen scheduling algorithm.

Environment:
	we will uesd the ubuntu enviroment and the command of the ubuntu ,if you have a windows enviroment,
	you should install the ubuntu on virtual box or VMware.

How to Run Your Program:
	you should have the three files in one folder(HW3.c , HW3.h ,test.txt) ,open the terminal and begun to send this comman to compile and run the code:
	1) gcc  HW3.c
	2) ./a.out test.txt
	
	after that you can see the resurt off all the tasks based on the scheduling algorithm.
